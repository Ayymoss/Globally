# IW4M-GlobalChat
Moderation: Global Chat for viewing the chat from the network's other servers. (Plugin for IW4MAdmin)

Command(s):
```
!globalchat (!gc) - Toggle's your global chat.
```

Leaving/switching servers will disable your global chat if enabled and must be enabled again.

If you want global chat to remain on during server switches create a feature request. 
I wanted to keep this plugin lightweight and adding persistents will require me storing the setting.

(It looks like this - note it doesn't repeat messages from local server as shown below, is just for demonstratable purposes)
